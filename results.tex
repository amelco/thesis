% COMMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION
%At low solute concentrations, the ion transport across membranes is limited by the diffusive flux of solute towards the membrane in case of high affinity uptake.Although mass flow towards the root caused by the transpiration stream is an additional solute transport mechanism to the root surface, its contribution to uptake at solute concentrations in the low micromolar range to uptake is estimated to be very low, often below 0.1% (cf.Tinker & Nye 2000) - Tinker P.B. & Nye P.H. (2000) Solute Movement in the Rhizosphere.Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford.

\chap RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

\sec Linear (LU) versus nonlinear (NLU) solutions

%In all simulated scenarios, the difference between LU and NLU models occurs only at values of solute concentration in soil water ($C$) below the threshold value \clim. This is expected because of the nature of the piecewise MM equation used in the model.
%{\bf (EXPLAIN THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS ONLY FOR C<Clim IN METHODOLOGY)}
%For both models, when solute concentration values at the root surface are higher than \c2, solute transport from soil to root is mostly driven by convection and, according to Equations \ref[eq_MM_mod] and \ref[eq_MM_linear], the uptake is passive only, with active uptake equal to zero. 
%For values of $C_0$ between the two threshold values (\c2 and \clim), the solute flux density is constant and NLU and LU are different only for $C$ values lower than $C_{lim}$ .

According to Equations \ref[eq_MM_mod] and \ref[eq_MM_linear], the difference between LU and NLU occurs only at the condition of concentration values at root surface below $C_{lim}$, due to the different considered boundary condition of each model. In this section, we will analyse whether the difference in the outputs of LU and NLU is significant to decide the situations that one model can be used over the another. For now on, the condition $C_0 < C_{lim}$ will be referred as `limiting concentration condition', or LCC, for short. 

%FIRST, TALK ONLY ABOUT THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCES. SHOW A TABLE OF VALUES. THEN GO TO THE STATISTICAL TEST TO SHOW THE SIGNIFICANCE. THEN SHOW THE DIFFERENCES IN Tr.

The differences between the two models were not significant when the whole time series is considered in calculations (from the initial to the final time step).
The reason is that the low value of $C_{lim}$ causes the LCC period to endure little time. 
In scenario 1, for instance, the duration of the LCC period is of about 1/30 of the total simulation. 
Moreover, due to the low value of $C_{lim}$, the LCC always occurs with very low solute uptake rates in all simulation scenarios. 
As consequence, the difference between the two models in all output variables are little noticeable at this time scale.
For example, the amount of solute extracted by the roots at the end of simulation are nearly the same for both models (Figure \ref[accumxt]). 
In addition, the LCC occurs at values of relative transpiration around 0.03 or less -- in a situation that the plant is already at high (water and/or osmotic) stress levels -- and close to the end of simulation (that stops when $Tr \leq 0.001$). 
%Because the difference between the models starts to occur at $T_r$ values around 0.03 or less, close to the end of simulation (that stops when $Tr \leq 0.001$), the time period in which the models to differ is small. 
A second reduction in the relative transpiration occurs and it can be noticed by an abrupt decrease in the transpiration rate (Figure \ref[diff_tr]).
A possible explanation is that, at this point, the solute uptake rate decreases, building a more negative value for the osmotic head and, consequently, reducing also the water uptake rate. It can be seen in Figure \ref[diff_tr] that the nonlinear equation causes a smoother $T_r$ reduction, which seems to be more appropriate for a natural phenomena.

There are two ways of making the difference between the two models be relevant: a) increase the value of $C_{lim}$ to make the LCC period be achieved faster, or b) look at that difference by a different time scale. 
We could not find a scenario that matched the first option. 
By analysing the Equation \ref[eq_clim2], it is noticeable that the maximum value for $C_{lim}$ is equal to $K_m$ and only if $q_0 \gg Km^2$. 
But, even if the value of $q_0$ attends this condition, Equation \ref[eq_c2] shows that $C_2$ would be higher and, since the uptake function is a piecewise equation, $C_0$ would have to be decreased until it reaches $C_{lim}$. 
At that time, the water flux would be low and the LCC period would be still small. 
However, by changing the scope and computing the differences between the two models starting from the time where LCC starts, a significant difference is noticed. 

Table \ref[tab_diff] shows the relative difference between the two models for concentration at root surface as function  of time ($C_0(t)$) and for concentration as a function of distance from axial center ($C(r)$) at the end of simulation, considering the shorter time scale (beginning from time where LCC starts). The Mann-whitney U test showed a significant difference for $C_0(t)$ but not for $C(r)$. The changes in root surface concentrations happen rapidly due to the decrease in solute uptake rate and it increase with time (Figure \ref[diff_t]), which is not the case for the concentration over the radial distance that the solute concentration for each segment is replenished by its neighbor, making the difference small with the increasing distance (Figure \ref[diff_r]). Scenario 4 never reached the LCC and it is presented in the results to show that the differences occurs only starting from this condition.


%The relative differences between the models, for simulation scenarios 1 to 4 at the LCC, are shown in Table \ref[tab_diff]. 
%Scenarios 1 and 2 showed similar results for $C_0(t)$, meaning that the potential transpiration has little impact on the computation of the relative difference. 
%Scenario 3 showed a greater difference because the limiting concentration condition was reached earlier than that of the other scenarios due to the lower initial concentration. 
%Nevertheless, for $C(r)$, the relative differences were of about 2.5\% for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. 
%This is due to the fact that at this condition, the flux of water and solutes towards the roots is higher near the roots and becomes small with the increasing distance.
%This gradient makes water and solute flow towards the roots. The higher the uptake, the higher the gradient and the solute transport. As NLU has a higher uptake rate, $C_0$ is smaller and the gradient is higher, resulting in little difference between LU and NLU.

\medskip

%All simulations had similar results then, to illustrate, we show the analysis of scenario 1 in Figures \ref[diff_t] and \ref[diff_r].

%The relative difference between both models, for the time selected outputs ($C_0(t)$ and $Ac(t)$), becomes significant only when calculated for this condition. 
%If the whole time series is analyzed, the difference is not significant since the condition of $C_0 < C_{lim}$ is achieved near the end of simulations and its contribution is small due to the low solute uptake rate at this time.

%PUT PLOTS TO EXPLAIN THIS

%This small flux can be observed in Figure \ref[diff_r]. At the end of simulation, the relative difference of LU and NLU was of 2.37\%. The relative difference between LU and NLU, in this case, ranged from XXX\% to XXX\% in the simulated scenarios.

%Figure~\ref[diff_t] shows that the difference between the estimated concentration at the root surface, for the linear (CL) and non-linear (CNL) models as a function of time and when $C_0 < C_{lim}$ for Scenario 1, is of around 43\%. 
%For the scenarios 2 to 4, the difference were of XXX\%, XXX\% and XXX\% respectively. 
%The Mann-Whitney U test for all scenarios when $C_0 < C_{lim}$, and the same output, showed a significant difference between the two models.
%When the same test is applied considering the whole time series, it shows non-significant difference.
%The list of the p-values for all cases and scenarios is presented in Table \ref[Utest].
%Figure~\ref[diff_r] shows the relative difference of concentration as a function of radial distance of 2.37\% and it can be noticed visually that the concentration profile does not change so much. 
%The U test corroborates with the visual analysis.
%The results for scenarios 2 to 4 were similar and it is not showed in the plots.

These results means that although there is indeed a difference between the two models, they are important only if looked in a shorter time scope. 
If the variable of interest arises from the whole time scope (accumulated uptake, for instance) or it is the concentration as a function of the radial distance, the differences are not important and both models can be used. 
In that case, it is preferred to use LU since a bigger time step can be used making the simulations faster.
On the other hand, considering that the metabolic response of the plant for different levels of concentration at root surface is immediate, or in situations where the value of $C_0$ is important, it is plausible to consider NLU for the simulations since it is the more realistic model.  
In this thesis we choose to use NLU since the values of $C_0$ are important to determine, precisely, the active and passive contribution to the solute uptake, which will be analysed in the next section.
% and, therefore, the differences between the two models outputs -- according to Equations  \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel] -- were calculated for this time period only. 

%%For the Scenario 1, this situation occurred at nearly the fourth simulated day. 
%%It was observed that although $C_0$ values are distinct between the two models, it does not add a significant contribution to the final extracted solute amount. 
%CNL tends to be smaller than CL because the uptake rate of NLU is always higher than that of LU, in accordance to their govern equations.
%Figure~\ref[diff_r], however, shows that the final concentration profile is nearly identical, presenting a difference of 0.3\%, and that the difference in the concentration at the root surface does not lead to a significant additional uptake. 
%Moreover, Figure~\ref[accumxt] shows that the 
%Nevertheless, in all simulation scenarios, the total solute taken up in the end of simulation was similar in both models, even with the time interval of greater uptake of NLU.
%%The absolute and relative differences between the estimated solute concentration for the linear (CL) and nonlinear (CNL) model was calculated according to Equations \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel], respectively.
%%From the \diff{} value resulted from Equations \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel], it can be inferred which model had a greater uptake.
%%For instance, if \diff{}~>~0, then the solute concentration estimated by the linear model (CL) was greater than that of the non-linear model (CNL). 
%%As the only output of solute is caused by root extraction, a lower concentration indicates a higher uptake so that NLU taken up more solute for this case. 
%%The opposite is true for \diff{}~<~0, and for \diff{}~=~0 both models had the same uptake.

%%where $C\!L$ and $C\!N\!L$ are the concentrations for LU and for NLU, respectively.
%When comparing differences in concentration between the two models, one has to be aware that $C\!N\!L<C\!L$ means that the uptake for NLU is greater than that of LU because, for a higher uptake, a higher amount of solute goes out from soil solution to inside the plant.
%Therefore if $d\!i\!f\!f\!<0$ then CNL > CL and LU uptake is greater; if $d\!i\!f\!f\!>0$ then $C\!N\!L<C\!L$ and NLU uptake is greater. Said that, we can see in Figure \ref[diff_t] that the uptake for NLU is greater then LU uptake at times when $C<C_{lim}$. This reflects a change also in the concentration profile for the latter times. Figure \ref[diff_r] shows the concentration profile at day 5 and the difference between $C\!L$ and $C\!N\!L$ through the profile. The higher NLU uptake increases the concentration gradient causing a higher solute flux (most diffusive since water flux is very small) from soil towards the root, resulting in a slightly higher concentration for NLU close to root surface ($d\!i\!f\!f\!.<0$).

%%Although the differences in concentration through time and radial distance are significant
%

%
%Nevertheless, the difference between LU and NLU is negligible for cumulative uptake. A difference of 80.9\% of concentration over time (Figure \ref[diff_t]) corresponds to only 0.318\% in the final concentration profile (Figure \ref[diff_r]) because the uptake at times where $C<C_{lim}$ is really low. It can be seen at the cumulative uptake plot (Figure \ref[accumxt]) the insignificant effect of this difference (for both models, the cumulative solute uptake is nearly the same).
%
%Similar to Figures \ref[diff_t] and \ref[diff_r], the results of the relative accumulated error, according to Equation \ref[error_rel], were of 64.975\% and 0.739\%; 37.364.3\% and 0.041\%; 36.144\% and 0.027\% over time and distance for scenarios 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
%%STATISTICS FOR U TEST HERE
%
%%IMPROVE, POLISH
%%The Mann--Whitney U test results corroborates with the differences analysis. Assuming a confidence interval of 95\%, {\it p}-values below 0.05 indicates that the two models are different (one has greater values than the other), i.e. the hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected. Table \ref[Utest] shows that, for scenarios 2, 3 and 4, concentration $C_0$ is significantly different for LU and NLU, but when analysing the cumulative uptake (for the same period of time where $C<C_{lim}$) the difference is not significant.
%

It is important to cite here the issues with stabilization in the numerical solution of NLU.
%In addition, some part of the differences was due to stability problems with the numerical solution for NLU. 
The change from equation 21 to equation 25 (change of boundary condition, from constant to nonlinear uptake rate) makes the numerical solution take some time to stabilize at the initial times if the time and space steps are not chosen properly. 
Many different time and space steps combinations had to be tested, for each scenario, to eliminate the problem. 
We found that, as a general rule, a small time step (commonly less than 0.1 s) can be used when the default space step is used. 
In situations that a finner space step is necessary, smaller values of $\Delta t$ are required. 
As mentioned before, decreasing the time step leads to an increase of the number of calculatoins making the simulation takes longer to complete. 
In our simulation scenarios, the time that they took to complete ranged from 40 minutes to 1.5 days.
%It needs to be found an optimal value for time and space step relation. 
%Stabilization problems were not found in LU.

%Since the differences between LU and NLU occurs for low concentration values and low solute flux, changes in relative transpiration are also negligible. The oscillation in the results due to the stabilization problem of the numerical solution is more likely to be noticed than the difference between the models. Figure \ref[diff_tr] shows the relative transpiration as a function of time and details the part where the oscillation occurs for each scenario. The absolute and relative differences are all due to oscillation problem, since $T_r$ turns out to be the same after complete convergence.

\citeonline[roose2009] stated that, for numerical solutions of convection-dispersion equation, the convective part might use an explicit scheme because convection, unlike diffusion, occurs only in one direction thus the solution at the following time step depends only on the values within the domain of influence of the previous time step. This set bounds on time and space steps, with a condition of stability given by ${r_0 q_0 \Delta t \over D} < \Delta r$. As the proposed model uses a fully implicit scheme, that might be the cause of the stabilization problems.

%No significant difference between LU and NLU was verified in all output files (water and solute flux, concentration profile, heads and relative transpiration – Figures 1a, 2a, 3, 4, 5 and 6), but a more detailed analysis was made by analyzing the overall results (values of solute concentration for all output times -- Figure 9b) and low concentration results (values of solute concentration for output times where $C<C_{lim}$ -- Figures 8 and 9a).

%For low concentration (Figures 8 and 9a), it is noticeable that LU presents values of solute concentration higher than NLU. This is expected because in LE, solute uptake is always less than in NLU due to its linearization. Nevertheless, when the overall results are analyzed (Figure 9b), we can see that the difference is small and can be neglected. This conclusion (negligible difference) can be verified once more when analyzing the cumulative solute uptake (Figure 10). 

%The conclusion, since no significant difference between LU and NLU was found, can be either to choose LU as it takes less time to run and has no stabilization problems, or to choose NLU except for the cases in which the stability problem is significantly high. Note that this is the conclusion for those specific scenarios as the results can be significantly different for different soil and solute types.

\sec Model results

According to the analysis of the differences between the linear (LU) and nonlinear (NLU) solution for the solute uptake equation showed in the last section, the simulations of scenarios 1 to 7 (Table \ref[tab_scenarios]) were made using NLU. 
In this section, the results of the main output variables ($C_0(t)$, $C(r)$ and $T_r(t)$) are presented for each scenario, as well as the active and passive contributions to solute uptake.
Simulation results are shown in Figures \ref[fig_C_t], \ref[fig_C_r] and \ref[fig_Tr_t] for the variations of soil hydraulic properties, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration values. 
All simulations had initial pressure head values of $-1$ m, so that both wet and dry soil conditions could be analysed.

%The general model predictions can be done by analysing scenario 1, chosen to be the default scenario (continuous line in Figures \ref[fig_C_t], \ref[fig_C_r] and \ref[fig_Tr_t]).
According to the piecewise Equation \ref[eq_MM_mod], the solute uptake rate is divided in three phases. Let us call them linear uptake phase when $C_0>C_2$, constant uptake phase when $C_{lim}<C_0<C_2$, and nonlinear uptake phase when $C_0<C_{lim}$.
For the simulation scenarios, the set of input parameters $h_{ini}$ and $C_{ini}$ were chosen in a way that the simulation always starts at the linear uptake phase, at which $T_r=1$ and solute uptake is done by mass flow of water only (passive uptake).
The water content and concentration in bulk soil are being depleted at the same rate, developing a period of constant concentration in soil water (Figure \ref[fig_C_t]).
In the case of the different soil types, as shown in Figure \ref[fig_C_t](a), although the initial concentration in bulk soil is the same (10 mol m$^{-3}$), initially, the concentrations in soil water at the root surface are different for each soil type. 
As the input parameter for water content is {\it h}-based, its initial value is calculated according to Equation \ref[eq_theta], which leads to different $\theta$ values for each soil, in accordance to their hydraulic parameters.

\medskip

The constant uptake phase is characterized by the depletion of $C_0$ at a constant rate, which starts some time after the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase.
%, when the total head reaches its limit value $H_{lim}$. 
The reduction in $q_0$ (reflected in $T_r$) increases $C_2$ value according to Equation \ref[eq_c2], therefore, the time that the constant uptake phase starts depends on the rate that $q_0$ decreases.
According to the results showed in Figure \ref[fig_C_t], the rate of decreasing $q_0$ is modified by soil type, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration.
%(WE CAN SEE IT IN THE DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES)
Moreover, in the constant uptake phase, the solute uptake by mass flow does not attend completely the plant demand,
thus, according to the model assumptions, an active uptake is developed and it becomes higher as the passive uptake (driven by mass flow of water) becomes lower (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t]).
This constant demand, filled by active and passive uptake, is maintained until $C_0$ reaches $C_{lim}$ which, in turn, increases as $q_0$ decreases, according to Equation \ref[eq_clim].
Active uptake reaches its maximum value when $C_0=C_{lim}$ (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t]) and the uptake will be limited by the concentration in the soil in further time steps, starting the nonlinear uptake phase.
It can be seen in Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t] that the time of the occurrence of the maximum value for active uptake depends on how fast passive uptake and $C_0$ decrease. 
Passive uptake decreases as fast as $q_0$ and $C_0$ decreases depending on the rate of solute uptake \im, therefore, the soil type, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration also affects the time for the maximum active uptake value and, consequently, the time at which the nonlinear phase starts.

\picw=17cm \cinspic all_contributionsxc.pdf
\caption/f {Active, passive and total uptake ($q_{s_0}$) as a function of concentration in soil water}
\medskip

The characteristic of the nonlinear uptake phase is a second falling rate phase for $T_r$. 
The total head $H$ is not able to fall below $H_{lim}$ and, as the solute uptake rate ($q_{s_0}$) decreases due to the limitation imposed by $C_{lim}$, a decrease in the water uptake rate ($q_0$) has to occur to maintain $H$ in its limiting value.
It is the shortest phase because it starts with very low values of $q_0$ and $T_r$, near the end time of simulation ($T_r=0.001$) in which $q_0$ is considered negligible.
Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c] showns that the three phases are present in all scenarios, excepting scenario 7. The water flux is small due to the hydraulic properties of the clay soil which causes also a small solute uptake. 
The concentration in soil solution at root surface, when $T_r\approx0$ (end of simulation), is higher than $C_{lim}$ (Figure \ref[fig_C_r](a)) and the active contribution ends in its maximum value (Figures \ref[fig_contrib_t] and \ref[fig_contrib_c]).

{\localcolor\Red IMPROVE: It is interesting that, with the same values of $I_m$ and $K_m$, a whole different sets of active and passive contributions can be generated just because of changes in soil and atmospheric parameters. This gives light to the really complex system that is the soil-plant and its relations with water and solute uptake.}

The final concentration profile is shown to be affected by all selected input parameters, excepting potential transpiration (Figure \ref[fig_C_r]).
Decreasing $T_p$ from 6 mm to 3 mm just changed the times of the limiting variables due to the decrease in water and solute fluxes. Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c], that has no time axes, shows the same amount of active and passive uptake contributions according to the actual concentration in the soil, for both scenarios 1 ($T_p=6$ mm) and 2 ($T_p=3$ mm).
This only can cause the same concentration profiles for every condition, although at different times.

The $C_0$ value at the end of simulation is never absolutely zero due to the asymptotic behaviour of $q_{s_0}$ function in response to decreasing $C_0$ values (Equation \ref[eq_case1]). 
%Even so, $C_0$ becomes so close to zero that it can be consider zero and, consequently, solute uptake also zero.

The model is able to quantify the active and passive contributions to the solute uptake, which can be used to distinguish osmotic and ionic stress.
Soil type, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration are factors that change the time that the concentration starts to decrease and the time that the active uptake is maximum.

%To better analyse the impact of the input parameters at the model results, a sensitivity analysis was made.

\sec Sensitivity analysis results

The relative partial sensitivity $\eta$ is the fraction of the relative change in parameter $P$ that will propagate in the prediction $Y$ \cite[quirijn_sens].
A value of $\eta=0.5$ indicates that a 1\% increase of $P$ results in 0.5\% increase in the prediction $Y$.
The value of $\eta$ found through a variation of a parameter is likely to change with variation of another parameter. 
Thus, it is profoundly difficult to make a sensitivity analysis that deals with all parameters variation combination of a complex model. 
Analyses are therefore restricted to a fixed set of parameters. 

Despite the solution to the convection-dispersion equation be the concentration in soil solution as a function of time and distance ($C(r,t)$), the model can give a wide range of another predictions, for instance: relative transpiration, pressure and osmotic potentials, water and solute uptake rates, and accumulated solute uptake.
Some of these predictions were selected to check how changes in soil and ion/plant parameters would affect them. 
The selected predictions $Y$ were end time of simulation ($t_{end}$), osmotic head ($h_{os}$), time at the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase ($t_{T_r}$), time at the onset of constant uptake phase ($t_{C_0}$) and accumulated solute uptake ($acc$);
and $P$ was the ion/plant ($I_m$ and $K_m$) and the soil hydraulic ($\alpha$, $n$, $K_s$, $\lambda$, $\theta_r$ and $\theta_s$) parameters.

\caption/f {Relative partial sensitivity of osmotic head at root surface in the end of simulation ($h_{os}$) and accumulated solute uptake ($acc$) to MM equation parameters for scenarios 1 to 7}
\medskip

Sensitivities to ion/plant parameters were high for $h_{os}$, that presented an inverse response to $I_m$ variation (Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_rest]).
This is due to the fact that, with higher values of $I_m$ there are higher uptake rates of solute in both phases of constant and nonlinear uptake, diminishing the value of concentration at root surface in the end of simulation (less negative values of osmotic head $h_\pi$).
On the contrary, higher values of $K_m$ make higher values of $C_{lim}$ that causes an increase of the nonlinear uptake phase and a decrease in the constant uptake phase.
With less time of potential solute uptake, the final concentration becomes higher.   
Thus, in general, a variation of 1\% in $K_m$ and $I_m$ cause, respectively, a decrease of 1.2\% and a increase of 1\%, approximately, in $h_{os}$. 
The exception was scenario 7 that showed low $\eta$ values for both parameters.
The reason is the small variation in concentration from the beginning to the end of simulation due to the low water and solute fluxes of the clay soil, explained in last section.

Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_rest] shows that, despite the sensitivity of $h_{os}$, $acc$ presented very low (close to zero) sensitivity to $K_m$ and $I_m$.
This is due to the fact that $I_m$ and $K_m$ just effectively act in the solute uptake rate in the constant and nonlinear uptake phases, since all the uptake in the linear uptake phase is due to mass flow of water. 
The period of constant and nonlinear phases are relatively short when compared with the linear phase period, causing a low influence of $I_m$ and $K_m$ in the accumulated solute uptake. 

Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_time] shows low sensitivity of the time related predictions to $I_m$ and no sensitivity to $K_m$.
As the model deals with constant potential transpiration only, the time at the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase is the exact time when $q_0$ decreases.
It is a phase that $I_m$ and $K_m$ does not exerts any influence, which explains the zero sensitivity of $t_{T_r}$ to those parameters.

\medskip

The predictions for $t_{end}$ and $t_{C_0}$ presented low sensitivity to $I_m$ and no sensitivity to $K_m$.
$I_m$ is directly related to the solute uptake rate (as it defines the plant demand) and $K_m$ to $C_{lim}$ value. 
Thus, higher values of $I_m$ causes higher uptake rates, faster decrease of water and solute contents and, therefore, a faster $T_r$ falling rate phase resulting in a sooner end of simulation.
%The no influence of $K_m$ over the time predictions is due to... EXPLAIN
%It is hard to be analyzed in another way than empirically testing.

Figures \ref[sensitivity_soil_time], \ref[sensitivity_soil_rest] and \ref[sensitivity_n] show the sensitivities to the soil hydraulic properties.
It is hard to discuss the sensitivities of the model outputs to each each parameter because of the great number of parameters and outputs tested.
Although the sensitivity results are presented separately for each parameter, output and scenario, the discussion will focus on the greatest and shortest $\eta$ values.
A more detailed and profound analysis with these sensitivity results can be done in the future (inclusive with empirical tests), as the results are shown here.

The model sensitivity for the parameter $\theta_r$ was the lowest in the selected time predictions.
An increase in $\theta_r$ decreases the available water content decreasing the time of $T_r$ and $C_0$ falling phases, consequently reducing $t_{end}$. 
%It also reduces the minimum value of $h$ (becomes more negative) increasing the maximum value of $h_\pi$ in the limiting total head ($H=-150$) m.
Increasing $\theta_s$, in turn, increases the available water content and therefore increases $t_{T_r}$, $t_{end}$ and $t_{C_0}$.
Depending on the potential transpiration, initial concentration and other parameters combinations, $h$
Thus, sensitivities to $\theta_r$ and $\theta_s$ are expected to be negative and positive, respectively, for the selected time predictions, corroborating the results (Figure \ref[sensitivity_soil_time]).

%In NU, salt is transported to the roots by convection, causing an accumulation of solutes at root surface. As water flux towards the root starts to decrease, salt is transported slower and carried away from the roots by diffusion (Figure \ref[cxt]). Because of the accumulation of salt in the root surface, the total head becomes limiting very fast and the transpiration is reduced faster than the other models (Figure \ref[Trs]).
%
%In CU, as the salt uptake rate is constant (Figure \ref[fluxesxt]), the concentration at root surface will decrease only if the uptake rate is larger than convection to the root surface. In the simulation, it happens in about half of the first day (Figure \ref[cxt]). This is very dependent on the uptake rate and water flux since for different conditions, the outcome could be different. Once the concentration at root surface is zero, the root behaves as a zero-sink, taking up solute at the same rate as which it arrives at the root, keeping the concentration there zero.
%
%In NLU, the concentration at root surface remains constant (Figure \ref[cxt]) until the convection to the root decreases as the water flux decreases (Figure \ref[fluxesxt]). This behavior is really dependent of initial concentration and water flux values since, in this case, $C_0$ at the beginning of simulation is greater than $C_2$, thus the solute uptake equals the convection of solutes to the root. At around day 1, convection starts to decrease but the solute uptake is yet greater than the plant demand (\im) due to convection. The solute uptake becomes constant (and equal to \im) after concentration in root surface is less than \c2. This is clear in XXXFigure 3a, where osmotic head continues constant for a period of time after the beginning of the falling transpiration rate. At this point, active uptake starts since convection only is not capable to maintain solute uptake rate at \im. The concentration keeps decreasing at this constant rate until its value is less than \clim. It is assumed that, at this point, the uptake is not equal to the plant demand for solute (\im) due to the concentration dependence of the MM equation (Figure \ref[fig_MM]). The water flux and the concentration are small as well as the active uptake, that can not maintain the uptake rate at \im. Therefore, a second limiting condition occurs when $C<C_{lim}$ causing another fast decrease in transpiration (Figure \ref[Trs]).
%The calculated concentrations $C_{lim}$ (Eq. \ref[eq_clim]) and \c2 (Eq. \ref[eq_c2]) depend on water flux and ion type (MM parameters $I_m$ and \km) meaning that the results can be quite different for other ion types and different values of initial water content.
%
%Figure \ref[fluxesxt] also shows the changes in solute flux at root surface for all models. At low concentrations (or at the second falling rate stage: $C<C_{lim}$), in NLU, the solute flux decreases gradually over time until the value of concentration is zero, where it will assume the zero-sink behavior.
%
%The concentration profile through the distance from root axial center is shown in Figure \ref[cxr]. The different approaches (NU, CU and NLU) result in different final concentrations profiles. The concentration dependent model NLU takes up more solute from soil solution due to the higher uptake rate in the constant transpiration phase.
%
%Figure \ref[Trs] shows the relative transpiration as a function of time for the three model types. The proposed model is able to maintain the potential transpiration for a longer period of time due to the extraction by passive uptake only ($C>C_2$) that keeps the osmotic head constant, allowing pressure head to reach smaller values at the onset of the limiting hydraulic conditions, as can be seen in Figure 6.
%
%Figure \ref[Trs] shows that CU and NLU have a more negative pressure head value for the onset of limiting hydraulic condition when compared to NU due to solute uptake that causes a increase in osmotic head (becomes less negative) and, in turn, decreases pressure head. Thus, the first falling rate phase of relative transpiration extends in time. The solute uptake at the beginning of the simulation (for concentrations greater than \c2) caused a greater accumulation of solute in the plant and also influenced the final solute profile, in which LU and NLU have less solute left in the soil profile (Figure 13).
%
%At the onset of the second falling rate phase ($C<C_{lim}$), water and solute fluxes decreases rapidly. In Figures XXX10 and 20 we can see that from day 4 to day 5, the fluxes are rapidly reduced, the water flux is near zero in the whole profile, meaning zero or really small convection. Thus, within this period, the transport of solute is made mainly by diffusion and the results of this diffusive transport can be visualized in Figures XXX17 and 18.
