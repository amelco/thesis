\chap RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

\sec Linear (LU) versus nonlinear (NLU) solutions

%In all simulated scenarios, the difference between LU and NLU models occurs only at values of solute concentration in soil water ($C$) below the threshold value \clim. This is expected because of the nature of the piecewise MM equation used in the model.
%{\bf (EXPLAIN THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS ONLY FOR C<Clim IN METHODOLOGY)}
%For both models, when solute concentration values at the root surface are higher than \c2, solute transport from soil to root is mostly driven by convection and, according to Equations \ref[eq_MM_mod] and \ref[eq_MM_linear], the uptake is passive only, with active uptake equal to zero. 
%For values of $C_0$ between the two threshold values (\c2 and \clim), the solute flux density is constant and NLU and LU are different only for $C$ values lower than $C_{lim}$ .

According to Equations \ref[eq_MM_mod] and \ref[eq_MM_linear], the difference between LU and NLU occurs only at the condition of concentration values at root surface below $C_{lim}$, due to the different considered boundary condition of each model. 
In this section, we will analyse whether the difference in the outputs of LU and NLU is significant to decide the situations that one model can be used over the another. 
For now on, the condition $C_0 < C_{lim}$ will be referred as `limiting concentration condition', or LCC, for short. 

%FIRST, TALK ONLY ABOUT THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCES. SHOW A TABLE OF VALUES. THEN GO TO THE STATISTICAL TEST TO SHOW THE SIGNIFICANCE. THEN SHOW THE DIFFERENCES IN Tr.

The differences between the two models were not significant when the whole time series is considered in calculations (from the initial to the final time step).
The reason is that the low value of $C_{lim}$ causes the LCC period to endure little time. 
In scenario 1, for instance, the duration of the LCC period is of about 1/30 of the total simulation time. 
Moreover, due to the low value of $C_{lim}$, the LCC always occurs with very low solute uptake rates in all simulation scenarios. 
As consequence, the difference between the two models in all output variables are little noticeable at this time scale.
For example, the amount of solute extracted by the roots at the end of simulation are nearly the same for both models (Figure \ref[accumxt]). 
In addition, the LCC occurs at values of relative transpiration around 0.03 or less -- in a situation that the plant is already at high (water and/or osmotic) stress levels -- and close to the end of simulation (that stops when $Tr \leq 0.001$). 
%Because the difference between the models starts to occur at $T_r$ values around 0.03 or less, close to the end of simulation (that stops when $Tr \leq 0.001$), the time period in which the models to differ is small. 
A second reduction in the relative transpiration occurs and it can be noticed by an abrupt decrease in the transpiration rate (Figure \ref[diff_tr]).
A possible explanation is that, at this point, the solute uptake rate decreases, building a more negative value for the osmotic head and, consequently, reducing also the water uptake rate. It can be seen in Figure \ref[diff_tr] that the nonlinear equation causes a smoother $T_r$ reduction, which seems to be more appropriate for a natural phenomena.

There are two ways of making the difference between the two models be relevant: 
a) increase the value of $C_{lim}$ to make LCC period be achieved faster, or b) look at that difference by a different time scale. 
We could not find a scenario that matched the first option. 
By analysing the Equation \ref[eq_clim2], it is noticeable that the maximum value for $C_{lim}$ is equal to $K_m$ and only if $q_0 \gg Km^2$. 
But, even if the value of $q_0$ attends this condition, Equation \ref[eq_c2] shows that $C_2$ would be higher and, since the uptake function is a piecewise equation, $C_0$ would have to be decreased until it reaches $C_{lim}$. 
At that time, the water flux would be low and the LCC period would be still small. 
However, by changing the scope and computing the differences between the two models starting from the time where LCC starts, a significant difference is noticed. 

Table \ref[tab_diff] shows the relative difference between the two models for concentration at root surface as function  of time ($C_0(t)$) and for concentration as a function of distance from axial center ($C(r)$) at the end of simulation, considering the shorter time scale only (beginning from the time where LCC starts). 
The Mann-whitney U test showed a significant difference for $C_0(t)$ but not for $C(r)$. 
The difference ({\it diff.}) between LU and NLU increases with time (Figure \ref[diff_t]),
%due to the abrupt decrease of solute uptake rate at root surface (that causes the second $T_r$ reduction).
%The change in $C_0$ root surface concentrations happens rapidly due to the decrease in solute uptake rate and it increases with time 
which is not the case for the concentration over the radial distance (Figure \ref[diff_r]), that the solute concentration for each segment is replenished by its neighbor, making the difference smaller with the increasing distance. 
Scenario 4 never reached the LCC and it is presented in Table \ref[tab_diff] to show that the differences only occurs when starting from $C_0 < C_{lim}$ condition.


%The relative differences between the models, for simulation scenarios 1 to 4 at the LCC, are shown in Table \ref[tab_diff]. 
%Scenarios 1 and 2 showed similar results for $C_0(t)$, meaning that the potential transpiration has little impact on the computation of the relative difference. 
%Scenario 3 showed a greater difference because the limiting concentration condition was reached earlier than that of the other scenarios due to the lower initial concentration. 
%Nevertheless, for $C(r)$, the relative differences were of about 2.5\% for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. 
%This is due to the fact that at this condition, the flux of water and solutes towards the roots is higher near the roots and becomes small with the increasing distance.
%This gradient makes water and solute flow towards the roots. The higher the uptake, the higher the gradient and the solute transport. As NLU has a higher uptake rate, $C_0$ is smaller and the gradient is higher, resulting in little difference between LU and NLU.

\medskip

%All simulations had similar results then, to illustrate, we show the analysis of scenario 1 in Figures \ref[diff_t] and \ref[diff_r].

%The relative difference between both models, for the time selected outputs ($C_0(t)$ and $Ac(t)$), becomes significant only when calculated for this condition. 
%If the whole time series is analyzed, the difference is not significant since the condition of $C_0 < C_{lim}$ is achieved near the end of simulations and its contribution is small due to the low solute uptake rate at this time.

%PUT PLOTS TO EXPLAIN THIS

%This small flux can be observed in Figure \ref[diff_r]. At the end of simulation, the relative difference of LU and NLU was of 2.37\%. The relative difference between LU and NLU, in this case, ranged from XXX\% to XXX\% in the simulated scenarios.

%Figure~\ref[diff_t] shows that the difference between the estimated concentration at the root surface, for the linear (CL) and non-linear (CNL) models as a function of time and when $C_0 < C_{lim}$ for Scenario 1, is of around 43\%. 
%For the scenarios 2 to 4, the difference were of XXX\%, XXX\% and XXX\% respectively. 
%The Mann-Whitney U test for all scenarios when $C_0 < C_{lim}$, and the same output, showed a significant difference between the two models.
%When the same test is applied considering the whole time series, it shows non-significant difference.
%The list of the p-values for all cases and scenarios is presented in Table \ref[Utest].
%Figure~\ref[diff_r] shows the relative difference of concentration as a function of radial distance of 2.37\% and it can be noticed visually that the concentration profile does not change so much. 
%The U test corroborates with the visual analysis.
%The results for scenarios 2 to 4 were similar and it is not showed in the plots.

These results mean that although there is indeed a difference between the two models, they are important only if looked in a shorter time scope. 
If the variable of interest arises from the whole time scope (accumulated uptake, for instance) or it is the concentration as a function of the radial distance, the differences are not important and both models can be used. 
In that case, it is preferred to use LU since a bigger time step can be used making the simulations faster.
On the other hand, considering that the metabolic response of the plant for different levels of concentration at root surface is immediate -- only a slightly change in $C_0$ causes a instantaneous plant reaction -- or in situations where the value of $C_0$ is important, it is plausible to consider NLU for the simulations since it is a more realistic model.  
In this thesis we choose to use NLU since the values of $C_0$ are important to determine, precisely, the active and passive contribution to the solute uptake, which will be analysed in the next section.
% and, therefore, the differences between the two models outputs -- according to Equations  \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel] -- were calculated for this time period only. 

%%For the Scenario 1, this situation occurred at nearly the fourth simulated day. 
%%It was observed that although $C_0$ values are distinct between the two models, it does not add a significant contribution to the final extracted solute amount. 
%CNL tends to be smaller than CL because the uptake rate of NLU is always higher than that of LU, in accordance to their govern equations.
%Figure~\ref[diff_r], however, shows that the final concentration profile is nearly identical, presenting a difference of 0.3\%, and that the difference in the concentration at the root surface does not lead to a significant additional uptake. 
%Moreover, Figure~\ref[accumxt] shows that the 
%Nevertheless, in all simulation scenarios, the total solute taken up in the end of simulation was similar in both models, even with the time interval of greater uptake of NLU.
%%The absolute and relative differences between the estimated solute concentration for the linear (CL) and nonlinear (CNL) model was calculated according to Equations \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel], respectively.
%%From the \diff{} value resulted from Equations \ref[error_abs] and \ref[error_rel], it can be inferred which model had a greater uptake.
%%For instance, if \diff{}~>~0, then the solute concentration estimated by the linear model (CL) was greater than that of the non-linear model (CNL). 
%%As the only output of solute is caused by root extraction, a lower concentration indicates a higher uptake so that NLU taken up more solute for this case. 
%%The opposite is true for \diff{}~<~0, and for \diff{}~=~0 both models had the same uptake.

%%%
%%where $C\!L$ and $C\!N\!L$ are the concentrations for LU and for NLU, respectively.
%When comparing differences in concentration between the two models, one has to be aware that $C\!N\!L<C\!L$ means that the uptake for NLU is greater than that of LU because, for a higher uptake, a higher amount of solute goes out from soil solution to inside the plant.
%Therefore if $d\!i\!f\!f\!<0$ then CNL > CL and LU uptake is greater; if $d\!i\!f\!f\!>0$ then $C\!N\!L<C\!L$ and NLU uptake is greater. Said that, we can see in Figure \ref[diff_t] that the uptake for NLU is greater then LU uptake at times when $C<C_{lim}$. This reflects a change also in the concentration profile for the latter times. Figure \ref[diff_r] shows the concentration profile at day 5 and the difference between $C\!L$ and $C\!N\!L$ through the profile. The higher NLU uptake increases the concentration gradient causing a higher solute flux (most diffusive since water flux is very small) from soil towards the root, resulting in a slightly higher concentration for NLU close to root surface ($d\!i\!f\!f\!.<0$).

%%Although the differences in concentration through time and radial distance are significant

%
%Nevertheless, the difference between LU and NLU is negligible for cumulative uptake. A difference of 80.9\% of concentration over time (Figure \ref[diff_t]) corresponds to only 0.318\% in the final concentration profile (Figure \ref[diff_r]) because the uptake at times where $C<C_{lim}$ is really low. It can be seen at the cumulative uptake plot (Figure \ref[accumxt]) the insignificant effect of this difference (for both models, the cumulative solute uptake is nearly the same).
%
%Similar to Figures \ref[diff_t] and \ref[diff_r], the results of the relative accumulated error, according to Equation \ref[error_rel], were of 64.975\% and 0.739\%; 37.364.3\% and 0.041\%; 36.144\% and 0.027\% over time and distance for scenarios 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
%%STATISTICS FOR U TEST HERE

%%IMPROVE, POLISH
%%The Mann--Whitney U test results corroborates with the differences analysis. Assuming a confidence interval of 95\%, {\it p}-values below 0.05 indicates that the two models are different (one has greater values than the other), i.e. the hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected. Table \ref[Utest] shows that, for scenarios 2, 3 and 4, concentration $C_0$ is significantly different for LU and NLU, but when analysing the cumulative uptake (for the same period of time where $C<C_{lim}$) the difference is not significant.
%

It is important to cite here the issues with stabilization in the numerical solution of NLU.
%In addition, some part of the differences was due to stability problems with the numerical solution for NLU. 
The change from equation 21 to equation 25 (change of boundary condition, from constant to nonlinear uptake rate) makes the numerical solution take some time to stabilize at the initial times if the time and space steps are not chosen properly. 
Many different time and space steps combinations had to be tested, for each scenario, to eliminate the problem. 
We found that, as a general rule, a small time step (commonly less than 0.1 s) can be used when the default space step is used. 
In situations that a finner space step is necessary, smaller values of $\Delta t$ are required. 
As mentioned before, decreasing the time step leads to an increase of the number of calculatoins making the simulation takes longer to complete. 
In our simulation scenarios, the time that they took to complete ranged from 40 minutes to 1.5 days.
%It needs to be found an optimal value for time and space step relation. 
%Stabilization problems were not found in LU.

%Since the differences between LU and NLU occurs for low concentration values and low solute flux, changes in relative transpiration are also negligible. The oscillation in the results due to the stabilization problem of the numerical solution is more likely to be noticed than the difference between the models. Figure \ref[diff_tr] shows the relative transpiration as a function of time and details the part where the oscillation occurs for each scenario. The absolute and relative differences are all due to oscillation problem, since $T_r$ turns out to be the same after complete convergence.

\citeonline[roose2009] stated that, for numerical solutions of convection-dispersion equation, the convective part might use an explicit scheme because convection, unlike diffusion, occurs only in one direction thus the solution at the following time step depends only on the values within the domain of influence of the previous time step. This set bounds on time and space steps, with a condition of stability given by ${r_0 q_0 \Delta t \over D} < \Delta r$. As the proposed model uses a fully implicit scheme, that might be the cause of the stabilization problems.

%No significant difference between LU and NLU was verified in all output files (water and solute flux, concentration profile, heads and relative transpiration – Figures 1a, 2a, 3, 4, 5 and 6), but a more detailed analysis was made by analyzing the overall results (values of solute concentration for all output times -- Figure 9b) and low concentration results (values of solute concentration for output times where $C<C_{lim}$ -- Figures 8 and 9a).

%For low concentration (Figures 8 and 9a), it is noticeable that LU presents values of solute concentration higher than NLU. This is expected because in LE, solute uptake is always less than in NLU due to its linearization. Nevertheless, when the overall results are analyzed (Figure 9b), we can see that the difference is small and can be neglected. This conclusion (negligible difference) can be verified once more when analyzing the cumulative solute uptake (Figure 10). 

%The conclusion, since no significant difference between LU and NLU was found, can be either to choose LU as it takes less time to run and has no stabilization problems, or to choose NLU except for the cases in which the stability problem is significantly high. Note that this is the conclusion for those specific scenarios as the results can be significantly different for different soil and solute types.

\sec Model results

According to the analysis of the differences between the linear (LU) and nonlinear (NLU) solution for the solute uptake equation showed in the last section, the simulations of scenarios 1 to 8 (Table \ref[tab_scenarios]) were made using NLU model. 
In this section, the results of the main output variables ($C_0(t)$, $C(r)$ and $T_r(t)$) are presented for each scenario, as well as the active and passive contributions to solute uptake.
Simulation results are shown in Figures \ref[fig_C_t]
to
%, \ref[fig_C_r] and 
\ref[fig_Tr_t] for variations of soil hydraulic properties, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration values. 
All simulations had initial pressure head ($h_{ini}$) values of $-1$~m, so that both wet and dry soil conditions could be simulated.

%The general model predictions can be done by analysing scenario 1, chosen to be the default scenario (continuous line in Figures \ref[fig_C_t], \ref[fig_C_r] and \ref[fig_Tr_t]).
According to the piecewise Equation \ref[eq_MM_mod], the solute uptake rate is divided in three phases. 
Let us call them linear uptake phase (LUP) when $C_0>C_2$, constant uptake phase (CUP) when $C_{lim}<C_0<C_2$, and nonlinear uptake phase (NUP) when $C_0<C_{lim}$.
For the simulation scenarios, the set of input parameters $h_{ini}$ and $C_{ini}$ were chosen in a way that the simulation always starts at LUP, in which $T_r=1$ and solute uptake is done by mass flow of water only (passive uptake).
In this phase, the water content and concentration in bulk soil are being depleted at the same rate, developing a period of constant concentration in soil water (Figure \ref[fig_C_t]).
For different soil types, as shown in Figure \ref[fig_C_t](a), although the initial concentration in bulk soil is the same (10 mol m$^{-3}$), initially, the concentrations in soil water at the root surface are different for each soil type. 
As the input parameter for water content is {\it h}-based, its initial value is calculated according to Equation \ref[eq_theta], that leads to different $\theta$ values for each soil in accordance to their hydraulic parameters.

\medskip

The constant uptake phase (CUP) is characterized by the depletion of $C_0$ at a constant rate, which starts some time after the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase.
%, when the total head reaches its limit value $H_{lim}$. 
The reduction in $q_0$ (reflected in $T_r$) increases $C_2$ value according to Equation \ref[eq_c2], therefore, the time that CUP initiates depends on the rate that $q_0$ decreases,
%According to the results showed in Figure \ref[fig_C_t], 
%the rate of decreasing $q_0$ is modified by
which changes with soil type, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration (Figure \ref[fig_C_t]).
%(WE CAN SEE IT IN THE DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES)
Moreover, in 
%the constant uptake phase
CUP, the solute uptake by mass flow does not attend completely the plant demand,
thus, according to the model assumptions, an active uptake is developed and it becomes higher as passive uptake (driven by mass flow of water) becomes lower in order to maintain the constant uptake rate (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t]).
This constant demand, filled by active and passive uptake, is maintained until $C_0$ reaches $C_{lim}$ which, in turn, increases as $q_0$ decreases, according to Equation \ref[eq_clim].
Active uptake reaches its maximum value when $C_0=C_{lim}$ (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t]) and the uptake will be limited by the concentration in the soil in further time steps, starting the nonlinear uptake phase (NUP).
It can be seen in Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t] that the time of the occurrence of the maximum value for active uptake depends on how fast passive uptake 
%(caused by the depletion of $C_0$ and reduction of $q_0$) 
decreases, which is 
%Passive uptake decreases 
as fast as $q_0$ and $C_0$ decreases depending on the rate of solute uptake \im{} (according to Equation \ref[eq_MM_mod] and model assumptions).
Therefore, the soil type, root density, initial concentration, and potential transpiration also affects the time for the maximum active uptake value and, consequently, the time at which NUP starts.

\medskip

The main characteristic of the nonlinear uptake phase (NUP) is a second falling rate phase for $T_r$ (as shown in Figure \ref[diff_tr]). 
The total head $H$ is not able to fall below $H_{lim}$ and, as the solute uptake rate ($q_{s_0}$) decreases due to the limitation imposed by $C_{lim}$ (Equation~\ref[eq_MM_mod]), a decrease in the water uptake rate ($q_0$) has to occur to maintain $H$ in its limiting value.
It is the shortest phase because it starts with very low values of $q_0$ and $T_r$, near the end time of simulation ($T_r=0.001$) in which $q_0$ is considered negligible.
However, it is the phase that the active uptake is dominant, being the major component of the solute uptake. 
According to \citeonline[tinker], at low concentrations, the ion transport across membranes is limited by the diffusive flux of solute towards the membrane in case of high affinity uptake 
%(low $K_m$ values) 
and the contribution of the solute uptake by mass flow of water (through the transpiration stream) is estimated to be very low, often below 0.1\%, which corroborates the results.

The results of active and passive contributions with respect to time and concentration in soil solution are shown respectively in Figures \ref[fig_contrib_t] and \ref[fig_contrib_c], according to Equation \ref[eq_MM_mod] and the model assumptions.
From the beginning of the simulations (wet soil, $T_r=1$), although it is in LUP, a constant uptake rate is developed. 
This is due to the fact that the model considers a constant potential transpiration rate through the day and
%, according to equation XXX, 
the water flux is directly related to $T_p$.
In that phase, the solute uptake is determined by $q_0$ and $C_0$ (Equation \ref[eq_case3]) but $C_0$ does not change because of the equal rates of depletion for water and solute.
A plant regulated process that limits the solute uptake (for example, a reflection coefficient) might be an alternative to regulate the uptake in this phase, however, it is not considered in this model.
Therefore, according to the model assumptions, the rate of solute uptake at LUP is constant and its value depends on the potential transpiration, soil type, root length density, and initial concentration and it does not depend on ion type (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_t]).

%The length of the two subsequent phases (CUP and NUP)
It is shown in Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c] different behaviours for the active and passive contributions for solute uptake as a function of soil concentration in soil solution.
Although changing from low to high values of $T_p$ causes changes in the length of the phases (LUP, CUP and NUP), no changes in the active and passive partitioning was detected with the variation of this parameter.
This result is straightforward 
%to explain 
since the potential transpiration affects the rate of the potential water flux and uptake which, consequently, affects the rate of solute uptake.
In a case that all model parameters of soil type, root density, ion type and solute uptake are the same, it is expected the same results, but in different times.
The most significant difference can be noticed from the different soil types (specially on clay soil) and root density values.

In the clay soil, the water flux is small due to its hydraulic properties which causes also a small solute transport and uptake by mass flow of water. 
The diffusive transport in the root surface (active uptake), rapidly becomes dominant (Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c], scenario 7).
Consequently, $C_0$ is slowly depleted in CUP whereas $\theta_r$ is achieved fast, causing a fast reduction of $q_0$ and $T_r$.
%The concentration in soil solution at root surface, 
%Still in the clay soil, 
When $T_r\approx0$ (end of simulation), $C_0$ value is 17.88~mol~m$^{-3}$ and higher than $C_{lim}$ 
%(5.97~mol~m$^{-3}$) 
(Figure \ref[fig_C_r](a)), the active contribution ends in its maximum value  and the NUP never starts (Figures \ref[fig_contrib_t] and \ref[fig_contrib_c], scenario 7).

With high root densities, the same soil volume extracts more water (and solutes) in a given time period, causing a belated but fast reduction in $T_r$. 
As high is the root density, higher is the steepness of the $T_r$ falling rate phase (Figure \ref[fig_Tr_t]). As a consequence, active uptake becomes more important with increasing $R$, as can be seen in Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c] (scenarios 1, 4 and 5).

The final concentration profile and relative transpiration are important model outputs to be analysed. 
The former is essential to determine the gradient of solute concentration and fluxes. 
Additionally, it can be used to compute the average concentration in a soil layer, essential for the model upscaling since it is required for one dimensional macroscopic models.
The later is used to predict water and osmotic stress, which can be related to biomass and yield predictions.
By default, the concentration profile is set to be stored in a file at the end of each day and in the end of simulation, but the user can choose any time interval to it.
Figure \ref[fig_C_r] shows that the concentration profiles -- and their averages -- in the end of simulation
are affected by all selected parameters variations, excepting potential transpiration.
It is expected that decreasing $T_p$ values causes only changes in the times which $C_0$ achieves the limiting values ($C_2$ and \clim) due to the decrease in water and solute fluxes. 
Corroborating the results, Figure \ref[fig_contrib_c] shows the same amount of active and passive uptake contributions, according to the actual concentration in the soil, for both scenarios 1 ($T_p=6$ mm) and 2 ($T_p=3$ mm),
and the $T_r$ falling rate phase initiates at higher times when $T_p$ is increased (Figure \ref[fig_Tr_t]).
In other words, the simulations showed that reducing $T_p$ might cause the same concentration profiles for every scenario, at different times, if all other parameters remains the same.
Soil type and root density change the final concentration profile respectively due to the different soil hydraulic properties that affects the water retention in soil and to the greater water and solute uptake per soil unit, as explained before in the active and passive uptake partitioning.
Similarly, they affect the steepness of the $T_r$ falling rate phase, also modifying the length of the phases LUP, CUP and NUP.
The initial concentration, for obvious reasons, changes the final concentration profile as initially they are already different.
It slightly changes the onset of falling $T_r$ rate phase. 
The greater variation can be observed in CUP and NUP.
With low values of $C_0$ (and $h_\pi$), $H_{lim}$ is achieved faster because there is less solute in soil to be taken up.
This causes a steeper $T_r$ reduction curve, shortening the time needed to $C_0$ be smaller than \clim.

%The $C_0$ value at the end of simulation is never absolutely zero due to the asymptotic behaviour of $q_{s_0}$ function in response to decreasing $C_0$ values (Equation \ref[eq_case1]). 
%Even so, $C_0$ becomes so close to zero that it can be consider zero and, consequently, solute uptake also zero.

Figures \ref[fig_contrib_t] and \ref[fig_contrib_c], considering scenarios 1 to 7, interestingly show that with the same values of $I_m$ and $K_m$ (same solute), a whole different sets of active and passive contributions can be observed just due to changes in soil, root and atmospheric parameters. 
All of these changes occurred in drying out simulations, with constant atmospheric demand.
In a real system, the water content constantly changes due to rain or irrigation, the solute concentration can be altered by addition of nutrients in the soil and the atmospheric demand is far to be constant.
The variation of all model parameters due to the natural changes that occur in a real system would generate a wide range of different responses of root uptake and its passive and active contributions, being hard to be predicted even with a more complex model.
It gives light to the really complex system that the model is trying to simulate and shows that we are still trying to understand the whole nature of solute movement in soil and its uptake.

The partitioning of the solute uptake by active and passive processes here demonstrated can serve as an initial insight for further studies. 
It gives light to the modelling of the metabolic partitioning of energy used by the plant that regulates solute uptake, which would be useful to predict its stress status and separate osmotic and ionic stressors.
To achieve that, there must be a more complex plant model than that presented in this thesis, which deals with metabolic processes as a function of the solute concentration within plant cells (nutritional status) and time.
Separating osmotic and ionic stress would lead to more detailed predictions of crop stress, growth and yield.
Besides, it also could aid water and nutritional management.
%Obviously, the model assumptions could be more complex and, as is known, the assumptions are extremelly important to the model predictions.
%Poor assumptions leads to poor predictions and a complex system like this in study (SPA) are often far from reality.
%Luckily, several computational/physical/mathematical models are being developed, each one with its own characteristics and limitations, in order to best approximate nature and its phenomena.


As a conclusion to this section, it was shown that the model is able to quantify the active and passive contributions to the solute uptake, which can be used to distinguish osmotic and ionic stressors in further works.
Soil type, root density, initial concentration and potential transpiration are factors that change the time that the concentration at the root surface starts to decrease and the time that the active uptake is maximum.

To better analyse the impact of the variation of the model input parameters, a sensitivity analysis is presented in the next section.

\sec Sensitivity analysis 

The relative partial sensitivity $\eta$ is the fraction of the relative change in parameter $P$ that will propagate in the prediction $Y$ \cite[quirijn_sens].
A value of $\eta=0.5$ indicates that a 1\% increase of $P$ results in 0.5\% increase in the prediction $Y$.
The value of $\eta$ found through a variation of a parameter is likely to change with variation of another parameter, 
%Thus, it is profoundly difficult to make a sensitivity analysis that deals with all combinations of parameters variation of a complex model. 
making the sensitivity analysis that deals with all combinations of parameters variation of a complex model being profoundly difficult to be done. 
Therefore, the analyses are commonly restricted to a fixed set of parameters. 

Despite the solution to the convection-dispersion equation be the concentration in soil solution as a function of time and distance ($C(r,t)$), the model can give a wide range of another predictions.
For instance: relative transpiration, pressure and osmotic potentials, water and solute uptake rates, and accumulated solute uptake.
Some of these predictions were selected to check how changes in soil and ion/plant parameters would affect them. 
The selected predictions $Y$ were end time of simulation ($t_{end}$), osmotic head ($h_{os}$), time at the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase ($t_{T_r}$), time at the onset of constant uptake phase ($t_{C_0}$) and accumulated solute uptake ($acc$);
and $P$ were the ion/plant ($I_m$ and $K_m$) and the soil hydraulic ($\alpha$, $n$, $K_s$, $\lambda$, $\theta_r$ and $\theta_s$) parameters. 

Sensitivities to ion/plant parameters were high for $h_{os}$, that presented an inverse response to $I_m$ variation (Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_rest]).
This is due to the fact that, with higher values of $I_m$ there are higher uptake rates of solute in both phases of constant and nonlinear uptake, diminishing the value of concentration at root surface in the end of simulation (less negative values of osmotic head $h_\pi$).
On the contrary, higher values of $K_m$ make higher values of $C_{lim}$ that causes an increase of the nonlinear uptake phase and a decrease in the constant uptake phase.
With less time of potential solute uptake, the final concentration becomes higher due to a lower amount of extracted solute.   
Thus, in general, a variation of 1\% in $K_m$ and $I_m$ cause, respectively, a decrease of 1.2\% and a increase of 1\%, approximately, in $h_{os}$. 
The exception was scenario 7 that showed low $\eta$ values for both parameters.
The reason is due to the small variation in concentration from the beginning to the end of simulation due to the low water and solute fluxes of the clay soil, explained in last section.

\caption/f {Relative partial sensitivity of osmotic head at root surface in the end of simulation ($h_{os}$) and accumulated solute uptake ($acc$) to MM equation parameters $I_m$ and $K_m$ for scenarios 1 to 7}
\medskip

Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_rest] shows that, despite the sensitivity of $h_{os}$, $acc$ presented very low (close to zero) sensitivity to $K_m$ and $I_m$.
This is due to the fact that $I_m$ and $K_m$ just effectively act in the solute uptake rate in the constant and nonlinear uptake phases, since all the uptake in the linear uptake phase is due to mass flow of water. 
The period of constant and nonlinear phases are relatively short when compared with the linear phase period, causing a low influence of $I_m$ and $K_m$ in the accumulated solute uptake. 

Figure \ref[sensitivity_MM_time] shows low sensitivity of the time related predictions to $I_m$ and no sensitivity to $K_m$.
As the model deals with constant potential transpiration only, the time at the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase is the exact time when $q_0$ decreases.
It is a phase that $I_m$ and $K_m$ does not exerts any influence, which explains the zero sensitivity of $t_{T_r}$ to those parameters.

\medskip

The predictions for $t_{end}$ and $t_{C_0}$ presented low sensitivity to $I_m$ and no sensitivity to $K_m$.
$I_m$ is directly related to the solute uptake rate (as it defines the plant demand) and $K_m$ to the $C_{lim}$ value. 
Thus, higher values of $I_m$ causes higher uptake rates, faster decrease of water and solute contents and, therefore, a faster $T_r$ falling rate phase resulting in a sooner end of simulation.
%The no influence of $K_m$ over the time predictions is due to... EXPLAIN
%It is hard to be analyzed in another way than empirically testing.

Figures \ref[sensitivity_soil_time], \ref[sensitivity_soil_rest] and \ref[sensitivity_n] show the sensitivities to the soil hydraulic properties.
%It is hard to discuss the sensitivities of the model outputs to each parameter because of the great number of parameters and outputs being tested.
Although the sensitivity results are presented separately for each parameter, output and scenario, the interactions between all parameters and simulated processes occurs sinergetically and concomitantly.
Due to the relative nature of the sensitivity (there is no absolute value of $\eta$ for one prediction with a variation of different parameters), an individual analysis can give an insight of the importance of a parameter to the model, but it truthly serves only for that particular simulation.
Therefore, due to the high number of soil hydraulic parameters, the discussion will focus only on those with the greatest $\eta$ values.
A more detailed and profound analysis with these sensitivity results can be done in the future, with empirical tests that might corroborate the results.

The parameter $n$ showed the highest (absolute) values of $\eta$ among the soil hydraulic properties, mainly for $h_{os}$ in the end of simulation, reaching the value of $-$23 for scenario 2 (Figure~\ref[sensitivity_n]).
Similar result was found by \citeonline[quirijn_sens], where the yield predictions of the evaluated model had higher sensitivity for the $n$ parameter.
%, also with one order of magnitude higher.
Figure \ref[fig_wrcs](a) shows how the water retention curve, following the \citeonline[genuchten80] model, changes with the variation of 1\% in $n$ parameter.
It shows that the same value of water content is reached with higher (more negative) values of pressure head and it affects both water retention and hydraulic conductivity. 
An increase in this parameter causes a more steep decrease in those hydraulic functions.
Increasing $n$ increases the solute uptake rate because the same initial pressure head originates lower values of water content and, consequently, higher solute concentration values.
Therefore, due to the higher solute uptake rate, the limiting value $H_{lim}$ is reached at later times, elongating LUP and resulting in less negative values of solute concentration in soil water ($h_\pi$), which
%That 
is what occurs in the simulations with loam soil (scenarios 1,2,3,4 and 5) but, despite the higher change in the water retention curve for the clay soil, it does not occur for scenario 7.
%(its variation parameter is the soil type: clay).
Due to the interactions between water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves, the overall effect is hard to be properly analyzed without an empirical test.
However, the cause for the lower value of $\eta$ in scenario 7 might reside on the fact that the solute uptake rate in this scenario is very low and, even if the variation of 1\% in $n$ causes a bigger change on the retention curve (and consequently in the concentration values), it does not strongly affect the solute uptake rate and, consequently, the change in $h_\pi$ (or $h_{os}$) at the end of simulation is small.

\medskip


For the time selected predictions ($t_{end}$, $t_{T_r}$ and $t_{C_0}$), the parameters $\theta_s$ and $\lambda$ presented the highest (absolute) $\eta$ values.
Increasing values of $\theta_s$ increases the available water content and increases at about the same proportion ($\approx$1\%) $t_{T_r}$, $t_{end}$ and $t_{C_0}$ due to the highest opportunity of water uptake with the same rate of $T_p$.
The parameter of the hydraulic conductivity function $\lambda$ causes an inverse response in $t_{end}$ prediction.
Higher values of $\lambda$ causes higher hydraulic conductivities with the same value of water content, which increases the water flux and uptake and decreases the time that the root surface reaches the limiting value $H_{lim}$, reducing the time of $T_r$ and $C_0$ falling phases, consequently reducing $t_{end}$.
Thus, sensitivities to $\lambda$ and $\theta_s$ are expected to be negative and positive, respectively, for the selected time predictions, corroborating the results (Figure \ref[sensitivity_soil_time]).
The higher sensitivity to $\theta_s$ can be explained due to the fact that the model has a powerful (possibly overestimated) solute extraction at LUP, either due to the lack of a plant regulated process for solute uptake at this phase or because the model does not consider a regulation in the solute uptake according to solute concentration inside the plant.

%The model sensitivity for the parameter $\theta_r$ was the lowest in the selected time predictions.
%An increase in $\theta_r$ decreases the available water content decreasing the time of $T_r$ and $C_0$ falling phases, consequently reducing $t_{end}$. 
%%It also reduces the minimum value of $h$ (becomes more negative) increasing the maximum value of $h_\pi$ in the limiting total head ($H=-150$) m.
%Thus, sensitivities to $\theta_r$ and $\theta_s$ are expected to be negative and positive, respectively, for the selected time predictions, corroborating the results (Figure \ref[sensitivity_soil_time]).

%In a general way, the selected time predictions showed to be much more sensitive to $\theta_s$ (disregarding $n$), being $\lambda$ the second in some scenarios.
%A possible explanation would be that the model has a powerful (possibly overestimated) solute extraction at LUP, due to the lack of a plant regulation process for the uptake.
%In that way, an increase in $\theta_s$ is more significant than an equal increase in $\theta_r$, as for low water contents the water uptake and solute transport by mass flow are smaller.

\medskip

For the solute related predictions,
%($h_{os}$ and $acc$),
$h_{os}$ showed high sensitivities to $\theta_r$, $\theta_s$ and $\alpha$ (Figure \ref[sensitivity_soil_rest]).
The sign of sensitivity of $h_{os}$ to $\theta_r$ and $\theta_s$ is straightforward.
As explained before, an increase in $\theta_r$ decreases the available water content, shortening the duration of LUP phase and $t_{T_r}$.
As a result, the period of highest solute uptake rate is reduced causing, in the end of simulation, a higher solute concentration at the root surface (more negative $h_{os}$).
On the other hand, an increase in $\theta_s$ causes a increase in the available water content, elongating LUP which reflects in lower solute concentration at the root surface (less negative $h_{os}$).
As the change in the retention curve is similar to the variation of $n$, the effects are also similar.
The end of simulation presents less negative values of $h_\pi$ due to the higher solute uptake rate.

Accumulated solute uptake at the end of simulation ($acc$) presented the lowest sensitivity to all parameters for almost all scenarios. 
As the majority of the solute uptake is done in LUP (first phase, where $C > C_2$), $acc$ is more affected when the duration of this phase is altered.
The sensitivity of $t_{T_r}$ serves as an indicator to the shortening/elongation of this phase, in a way that $acc$ responds more strongly when $t_{T_r}$ is also affected.
%, as Figures \ref[sensitivity_soil_time] to \ref[sensitivity_n] show.
The parameter $\alpha$ affects the water retention curve by changing the air entry pressure head.
An increase in its value makes that the same water content corresponds to a less negative pressure head (Figure \ref[fig_wrcs](b)).

With this simple sensitivity analysis, we can conclude that the parameters that need more carefulness to measure are: $\theta_r$, $\theta_s$, $\alpha$, $I_m$ and $K_m$ which affects more strongly the solute concentration at root surface in the end of simulation, $\theta_s$ which strongly affects the time at the limiting values are reached, and $n$ which strongly affects all selected predictions, mainly $h_{os}$.

\sec Solute uptake models comparison

%The incorporation of solute uptake in the model of \citeonline[liersolute] shows to be very complex according to the results that has been shown. 
%The differences are shown in this section, together with the constant uptake model developed by \citeonline[willigen1] to 
%{\localcolor\Red SECTION INTRODUCTION}

As the model developed in this thesis is an addition to the model of \citeonline[liersolute], in which does not considers solute uptake, a comparisson between the two models is necessary.
Additionally, the results are compared with a model of constant solute uptake (based on the work of \citeonline[willigen1]) to show the differences between these two uptake approaches.

Figure \ref[fig_C0] shows the differences in the solute concentration at root surface as a function of time for the three different models. 
In ZU, salt is transported to the roots by convection, causing an accumulation of solutes at root surface. 
As water flux towards the root starts to decrease, salt is transported slower and carried away from the roots by diffusion. 
CU presents the same behaviour with a slightly lower $C_0$ value, due to the small solute uptake value. 
%The difference between ZU and CU concentrations increases as the water flux towards the root decreases, making the transport by diffusion away from the root becomes more important than by convection towards the roots.
As higher is the value of the constant uptake rate and as lower is $T_p$ in CU, less solute will accumulate in the root surface and more similar CU and NLU will become, as can be seen in the gray line of Figure \ref[fig_C0].

\def\descc{Gray line is CU with the constant of solute uptake rate 10 times higher}

\caption/f {Soil solution concentration at root surface as a function of time for constant (CU), zero (ZU) and nonlinear (NLU) uptake models. \descc}
\medskip

For ZU and CU, $C_0$ 
%the concentration 
starts to diminish (less negative values of $h_\pi$) as soon as $T_r<1$, because $H$ at root surface reached the limiting value of $-$150 m (Figure~\ref[fig_heads1]).
%due to $H_0=-150$ m (Figure \ref[fig_heads1]).
In CU, as the solute uptake does not depend on the solute concentration in soil (it is a constant), the solute transport by convection becomes less important than the movement by diffusion as the water flux towards the root diminishes.
Thus, the solute depletion at the root surface is due both to the uptake and to the diffusive transport away from the roots.
For the case of NLU (Figure \ref[fig_heads2]), an accumulation period is not developed due to the high solute uptake rate in LUP (as can be seen in Figure \ref[fig_qst_detail], all solute carried by mass flow of water is taken up).
The time needed to $C_2$ increases until it becomes higher than $C_0$ (explained in the last section) generates a delay between the onset of the $T_r$ falling rate phase and the time that $C_0$ starts to diminish.
Moreover, the higher uptake of NLU causes lower values of osmotic head ($h_\pi$) and generates a longer period of potential transpiration rate ($T_r=1$).
For the case of CU and ZU, $T_r$ starts to diminish around the 21th day whilst for NLU it is about the 24th day.

Figure \ref[fig_qst_detail] shows the solute uptake rate (solute flux at root surface $q_{s_0}$) as a function of time for each model.
It shows the three uptake phases for NLU (LUP, CUP and NUP), the constant uptake rate for CU, and the zero uptake rate for ZU, according to their respective equations.
Once more, it is noticeable that at the first uptake phase (LUP) the solute uptake rate is higher than the other two phases due to the constant potential transpirations rate and the lack of a plant controlled mechanism of solute uptake regulation.
Nevertheless, this result is compatible with the model assumption 1, that the plant does not control the solute taken up by mass flow of water.
This result must be compared with experimental data of solute uptake of non-stressed plants to elucidate whether a plant regulated mechanism of uptake must be added to the model.

\medskip


The result of the total amount of solute extracted by the plant is shown in Figure \ref[fig_accsol].
It can be understand as the amount of solute accumulated inside the plant.
The high uptake rate at LUP, in NLU model, causes a fast accumulation of solute inside the plant due to passive uptake.
According to the model assumptions, the plant does not regulate passive uptake (or the uptake caused by mass flow of water), which, for the case of NLU model in all simulated scenarios, is the greatest contribution to the uptake.
The ZU model obviously does not accumulate any solute and LU model accumulates it linearly, at a constant rate.

\medskip

\picw=11cm \cinspic accumxt_models.pdf
\caption/f {Cumulative solute uptake as a function of time for constant (CU), zero (ZU) and nonlinear (NLU) uptake models, for scenario 1}
\medskip

As it is clear in the model assumptions, the plant does not regulate passive uptake (and that is the reason for it is called `passive') and the solute concentration inside the plant does not affect the uptake.
{\tblue
Furthermore, based on these assumptions, it can be plausibly inferred that the governing mechanism of the toxic effect is the passive uptake.
}
If the concentration inside the plant is already at its limiting value (meaning that, for that specific time period, the plant does not need that solute anymore), it can stop the active mechanism (as it is plant regulated by metabolic processes) but it is not allowed to stop the passive process, that would be the closure of stomata to stop the water uptake.
The plant then has to choose what is physiologically more positive to it: either close the stomata to not enter in a toxicity process or extract more solute and be affected by the toxic effects of the solute excess inside the cells. 
Therefore, as a further model improvement, the solute concentration inside the plant has to be considered so it can regulate the uptake.


%{\tred
%Thus, in a further improvement of the model to separate ionic and osmotic stress, it can be assumed that the plant will enter in a stage of toxicity by means of passive uptake since active uptake is plant regulated.
%In the current proposed model, in a situation that the plant is in osmotic stress, it is in CUP with $T_r < 1$ and with passive and active uptake contributions working.
%Once the plant concentration is accounted into the model and the concentration inside the plant already reached the critical level (value the above it, the solute will start to produce toxicity effects), the plant can eliminate the active uptake (because it is plant regulated) but can not eliminate passive uptake.
%Therefore, in this situation, all solute that is extracted by the plant will contribute to a unavoidable accumulation of solute inside the plant, causing the toxicity effects of the ionic stress.
%}
%
%{\tred
%When solute uptake is considered, the value of $H$ diminishes (becomes more negative) slower either because $h_\pi$ becomes less negative or more negative at a smaller rate, which causes that the limiting value of $H$ be achieved on a later time, according to the solute uptake rate.
%Figure \ref[fig_Tr] shows that the onset of the falling $T_r$ phase, for NLU model, occurs in a later time when compared with ZU or CU (which has a smaller solute uptake rate) models.

%\medskip

As explained before, the LU model might develop a period of accumulation of solute near the root surface depending on the potential transpiration rate and solute uptake rate values.
This period is then followed by a period of diffusion of solute away from the roots which, along with the solute uptake, are responsible for the depletion of solute at the root surface.
This behaviour causes a different solute concentration profile in the end of simulation when compared with the proposed solute uptake model (NLU).
It can be seen in figure \ref[fig_C] (in the grey line that represents the CU model with a uptake rate 10 times higher) that the diffusion of solute away from the roots generates a higher concentration somewhere between $r_0$ and $r_m$ in CU model, as opposed to NLU model, which has no solute accumulation period and its concentration profile diminishes when approaching $r_0$.
It is also shown that the models that consider solute uptake (CU and NLU) present a smaller concentration at $r_m$ due to the higher solute transport towards the root generated by the gradient caused by the solute uptake at $r_0$.

%In NU, salt is transported to the roots by convection, causing an accumulation of solutes at root surface. As water flux towards the root starts to decrease, salt is transported slower and carried away from the roots by diffusion (Figure \ref[cxt]). Because of the accumulation of salt in the root surface, the total head becomes limiting very fast and the transpiration is reduced faster than the other models (Figure \ref[Trs]).
%
%In CU, as the salt uptake rate is constant (Figure \ref[fluxesxt]), the concentration at root surface will decrease only if the uptake rate is larger than convection to the root surface. In the simulation, it happens in about half of the first day (Figure \ref[cxt]). This is very dependent on the uptake rate and water flux since for different conditions, the outcome could be different. Once the concentration at root surface is zero, the root behaves as a zero-sink, taking up solute at the same rate as which it arrives at the root, keeping the concentration there zero.
%
%In NLU, the concentration at root surface remains constant (Figure \ref[cxt]) until the convection to the root decreases as the water flux decreases (Figure \ref[fluxesxt]). This behavior is really dependent of initial concentration and water flux values since, in this case, $C_0$ at the beginning of simulation is greater than $C_2$, thus the solute uptake equals the convection of solutes to the root. At around day 1, convection starts to decrease but the solute uptake is yet greater than the plant demand (\im) due to convection. The solute uptake becomes constant (and equal to \im) after concentration in root surface is less than \c2. This is clear in XXXFigure 3a, where osmotic head continues constant for a period of time after the beginning of the falling transpiration rate. At this point, active uptake starts since convection only is not capable to maintain solute uptake rate at \im. The concentration keeps decreasing at this constant rate until its value is less than \clim. It is assumed that, at this point, the uptake is not equal to the plant demand for solute (\im) due to the concentration dependence of the MM equation (Figure \ref[fig_MM]). The water flux and the concentration are small as well as the active uptake, that can not maintain the uptake rate at \im. Therefore, a second limiting condition occurs when $C<C_{lim}$ causing another fast decrease in transpiration (Figure \ref[Trs]).
%The calculated concentrations $C_{lim}$ (Eq. \ref[eq_clim]) and \c2 (Eq. \ref[eq_c2]) depend on water flux and ion type (MM parameters $I_m$ and \km) meaning that the results can be quite different for other ion types and different values of initial water content.
%
%Figure \ref[fluxesxt] also shows the changes in solute flux at root surface for all models. At low concentrations (or at the second falling rate stage: $C<C_{lim}$), in NLU, the solute flux decreases gradually over time until the value of concentration is zero, where it will assume the zero-sink behavior.
%
%The concentration profile through the distance from root axial center is shown in Figure \ref[cxr]. The different approaches (NU, CU and NLU) result in different final concentrations profiles. The concentration dependent model NLU takes up more solute from soil solution due to the higher uptake rate in the constant transpiration phase.
%
%Figure \ref[Trs] shows the relative transpiration as a function of time for the three model types. The proposed model is able to maintain the potential transpiration for a longer period of time due to the extraction by passive uptake only ($C>C_2$) that keeps the osmotic head constant, allowing pressure head to reach smaller values at the onset of the limiting hydraulic conditions, as can be seen in Figure 6.
%
%Figure \ref[Trs] shows that CU and NLU have a more negative pressure head value for the onset of limiting hydraulic condition when compared to NU due to solute uptake that causes a increase in osmotic head (becomes less negative) and, in turn, decreases pressure head. Thus, the first falling rate phase of relative transpiration extends in time. The solute uptake at the beginning of the simulation (for concentrations greater than \c2) caused a greater accumulation of solute in the plant and also influenced the final solute profile, in which LU and NLU have less solute left in the soil profile (Figure 13).
%
%At the onset of the second falling rate phase ($C<C_{lim}$), water and solute fluxes decreases rapidly. In Figures XXX10 and 20 we can see that from day 4 to day 5, the fluxes are rapidly reduced, the water flux is near zero in the whole profile, meaning zero or really small convection. Thus, within this period, the transport of solute is made mainly by diffusion and the results of this diffusive transport can be visualized in Figures XXX17 and 18.

%The effects of the MM-based uptake model applied in the convection-dispersion equation are noticed in very low concentration values.
%This is due to the selected model assumptions but they are acceptable.

%{\tred
%The addition of a solute uptake function to the already existent model of solute transport was able to improve it, giving more realistic results to the simulations.
%Moreover, it is possible to, in further developments, add a more realistic plant concentration model to improve the proposed model, in a way that the uptake will also depend on the concentration inside the plant, and not only on concentration in soil.
%In that way, the active and passive partitioning would be essential to determine the stress status of the plant, separating osmotic and toxicity effects on biomass production and yield.
%Irrigation and nutrition management would then be improved.

\sec Analytical comparison

The proposed numerical model is compared with the analytical model of \citeonline[cushman], in Figure \ref[fig_analytic], with input parameters of scenario 1.
The analytical model has the disadvantage to deal with constant water flux (steady-state condition) and dispersion coefficient.
Therefore, an average of the simulated water flux of scenario 1 was calculated to serve as an input in the analytical model.
In the numerical model, the dispersion coefficient changes in time and distance.
Therefore, to get similar concentration profiles, the analytical model had a value of $D=1.98 \cdot 10^{-7}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ (or $1.98\cdot10^{-11}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$) whereas the numerical model had dispersion coefficients that ranged from $4.13 \cdot 10^{-10}$ to XXX m$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at the root surface.
The maximum rate of solute uptake of both models were the same ($J_{max}=I_m$), as well as the root absorbing power was equal to the plant affinity to the solute ($k=K_m$).
The input time to evaluate the concentration profile in the analytical model was the same of the numerical model for scenario 1 ($t_{end}=30$ days).

{\tred
In that way, the concentration profile of the analytical model corroborates the results of the numerical model, despite the differences of their input values.

The numerical model follows the same behavior as the analytical one, but we can conclude that, the numerical model, despite its limitations, has more flexibility and can simulate a wider range of scenarios and possibilities when compared with the analytical one.
On the other hand, analytical models has the advantages of predict in a direct way several things as time when concentration is equal to zero, and we can formulate expressions to understand what happens if the water flux is zero, if the solute flux is zero, and so on.
Expressions can be generated to analyse a scenario even without make any simulation,  but just by analysing the expressions.

\sec Guidelines to upscale the proposed model

{\tred
The proposed model simulates the transport and uptake of solutes from the soil to a single root and, because of the considered geometry (Figure \ref[root_zone]), it can be easily upscaled to consider a single plant.
There are more complex models that simulates crop production at field scale and, since the proposed model deals with and quantify active and passive uptakes, it can be used to simulate osmotic and ionic stressors that cause a yield decrease.
For this, the present model has to be upscaled, or goes from a micro to a macroscopic scale.
There are 1D, 2D and 3D macroscopic models.
Here it will be shown how to upscale to a 1D model as for the other dimensions is just do everything again.

One dimensional models usually consider vertical fluxes. 
The gradients are vertical and all movements and exchanges are vertical, between the layers of the model.
We will focus in the soil layers.
The proposed model simulates horizontal fluxes and therefore horizontal gradients.
Although the model calculates the horizontal gradients and fluxes between all segments and each concentration for them, a representative average soil concentration has to be computed.
As the calculations takes some time to run, as showed in the previous sections, the number of segments must be the smallest as possible.
As we saw in FIGURE XXX when the concentration in the root surface is not important, we can use the LU and the generated concentration profile can be used to calculate the average soil concentration.
As LU is more flexible to deal with time and space steps, it is the chosen model to use in the upscaling.
More studies must be done to determine the ideal space steps to use for each time step scale, since macroscopic models can use time steps that range from seconds to days.
