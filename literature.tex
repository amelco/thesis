%The processes that involves solute uptake by the plants have been subject of study of many researchers since the beginning of the last century. 
%Solute flow in the soil is directly related to the water flow and uptake by the plants, and they are indissociable.
%Therefore, studying water flow is a obligated requirement to understand solute flow, which makes pioneer works such as of GARDNER crucial to the further development of the theories. He described the processes of fluxes from soil to plant as a set of resistances that should be overpassed to the flow to happen
