%The processes that involves solute uptake by the plants have been subject of study of many researchers since the beginning of the last century. 
%Solute flow in the soil is directly related to the water flow and uptake by the plants, and they are indissociable.
%Therefore, studying water flow is a obligated requirement to understand solute flow, which makes pioneer works such as of GARDNER crucial to the further development of the theories. He described the processes of fluxes from soil to plant as a set of resistances that should be overpassed to the flow to happen

Solute transport in soil and uptake by the plants are subjects that have extensively been studied in the last half century and, as a result, several simulation models have been developed to predict water and solute flows within the vadose zone. They are usually classified as being microscopic or macroscopic models, according to the scale that the processes are considered. The
