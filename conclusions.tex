\chap CONCLUSIONS

The partial differential equation of convection-dispersion was numerically solved using a fully implicit scheme, considering a transient state of solute flow and a solute uptake rate that is dependent on the solute concentration in the soil.
This solution was then incorporated into the model of \citeonline[liersolute] including the root solute uptake.
The resulting model has a linear and a non-linear solution for the solute uptake equation and shows a good agreement with the analytical solution proposed by \citeonline[cushman] which also considers a concentration dependent uptake as the boundary condition at the root surface.
The linear and non-linear solutions are significantly different only when comparing the concentration as a function of time for times where $C_0 < C_{lim}$ (non-linear uptake phase, NUP).

Simulations results show that a second reduction in the relative transpiration may occur by a reduction of the solute uptake rate resulting in a reduction of water flux due to the decreasing value of pressure head needed to maintain the limiting value of $H=H_{lim}$.
This second reduction shows that the limiting value $C_{lim}$ can be an important parameter to determine changes in the combined water and osmotic stress in low concentration situations, suggesting it requires more investigation.

The model showed able to be able to quantify the active and passive contributions to the solute uptake, which can be used to distinguish osmotic and ionic stressors in further works.
Soil hydraulic properties, root length density, initial concentration and potential transpiration are factors that change the time that the concentration at the root surface starts to decrease and the time that the active uptake is maximum. 

%The model has the ability to partition active and passive contributions to the solute uptake.
%The major part of the uptake is done passively  in the LUP and it is possibly overestimated due to the high solute uptake by mass flow of water which is not regulated by the plant. 
%Active uptake grows with decreasing concentration until it becomes dominant in the NUP.
%The maximum value for passive and active uptake depends on soil type, initial concentration, root density and potential transpiration.

From the sensitivity analysis, we conclude that the quantities requiring a careful parameterization are: $\theta_r$, $\theta_s$, $\alpha$, $I_m$ and $K_m$, affecting strongly the solute concentration at the root surface at completion of simulation, $\theta_s$ affecting the time at wich limiting values of solute concentration are reached, and $n$ which strongly affects all selected predictions, mainly $h_\pi$. 

%All soil hydraulic parameters affect in an average relation of 1/1 the model outputs.
%The parameter $n$ showed to strongly affect the predictions with one order of magnitude higher than the others.
%As it belongs to both hydraulic conductivity and water retention equations, it is hard to explain this result without an empirical test.
%Similarly, the plant/solute related parameters $I_m$ and $K_m$ affects the model in a 1/1 relation, making them important parameters of the model, requiring precise measurements at its aquisition.

The proposed model uses an implicit scheme for the numerical solution of the convection-dispersion, including variable space steps and diffusion coefficients.
A more detailed investigation of stability issues for this kind of model would benefit its applicability and is suggested as a future work.

%{\tred Root length density particularly has to be cautiously measured because it affects the model results very significantly.}

%The proposed model simulates the solute flux and root uptake considering a soil concentration dependent uptake. There was no significant difference between linear and non-linear solutions for the simulated scenarios. The results of uptake for the proposed model showed that the limiting potential is reached at a higher pressure head, increasing the period of potential transpiration. It also showed a second limiting condition that happens at the time when $C<C_{lim}$ caused by a insufficient supply of solute at the same rate of plant demand. The proposed model is also able to do a partition between active and passive uptake which will be important to simulate the plant stress due to ionic or osmotic components, according to the solute concentration inside the plant.
%Comparison between the numerical and the analytical solution proposed by Cushman is in process.

%The model did not present stability issues in the simulations of the selected scenarios for a $\Delta t$ value of 0.01 s.
