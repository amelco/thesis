\chap CONCLUSION

The proposed model simulates the solute flux and root uptake considering a soil concentration dependent uptake. There was no significant difference between linear and nonlinear solutions for the simulated scenarios. The results of uptake for the proposed model showed that the limiting potential is reached at a higher pressure head, increasing the period of potential transpiration. It also showed a second limiting condition that happens at the time when $C<C_{lim}$ caused by a insufficient supply of solute at the same rate of plant demand. The proposed model is also able to do a partition between active and passive uptake which will be important to simulate the plant stress due to ionic or osmotic components, according to the solute concentration inside the plant.
Comparison between the numerical and the analytical solution proposed by Cushman is in process.
